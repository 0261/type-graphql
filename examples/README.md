- [authorization](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/authorization)
- [validation](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/automatic-validation)
- [interfaces and inheritance](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/interfaces-inheritance)
- [enums and unions](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/enums-and-unions)

## 3rd party libs integration
- [TypeORM (manual, synchronus)](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/typeorm-basic-usage)
- [TypeORM (automatic, lazy relations)](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/typeorm-lazy-relations)
